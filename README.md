# ok i have a new idea

- connecting (__healthy?__) grocery stores to their nearest food bank to improve health disparities caused by low food security and nutrition (this sounds like something that may have already been done before so maybe focus on nutrition?)
- could be interesting to see how like whole foods, health food stores, can be connected to food banks in areas of low income
- DATA: 

- nutrition:
user enters location -> model identifies whether in area of low food security -> directions to local food bank? or optimizing best route of public transit to get to healthy options

- wait ok so heres this: **produce**
an app like uber but for fresh produce from grocery stores??? like grocery stores sends text alerts to everyone in vicinity who can get free produce instead of it being thrown or composted
this is a lot of work and i dont know how to do any of it so
but would be cool otherwise idk

- ok easier: a web app where anyone, not just grocery stores, can alert people if they are about to throw away food? like tindr but for food?? omg food tindr hold up hahahahaha

- new improved food tindr (foodr?? lmao) : there are definitely health risks involved but like whatever
