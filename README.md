### it do happen like that sometime

ok so for now i dont have a clear idea of what i want to do literally at all, but I have the most basic flask framework set up. 

data.py -> scrapes data from websites and compiles into nice data frames (output = multiple dfs)
model.py -> takes in pretty dataframe(s) and computes some result (output = multiple dfs)

feed back into processed.html for dashboard effect
